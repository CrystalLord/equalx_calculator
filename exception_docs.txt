===========================================================================

The parser section of the calculator can throw various exceptions. Due to
my lack of knowledge with C++, I don't really want to risk putting in error
classes. So instead, they are throw integers only. This is a guide for each
exception.

===========================================================================

stringcalculator.cpp:

	100	Somewhere along the line, the input somehow made an
		expression element vector of size 2. This is impossible to
		properly parse, and thus throws this exception. This would
		likely fall under a syntax error.

	101	The input string ended in an operation: e.g. 5+4*. This
		is a user made syntax error
	
	102	The input has a closing parentheses, but not a matching
		open parentheses. The user has made a syntax error.

expressionelement.cpp:
	
	200	An invalid operator was in the input. The program does not
		know how to handle it, and throws this exception.
	
	201	The operator that is being used to perform a calculation is
		either not an operator or it's not surrounded by numbers.
